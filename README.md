# Weather app made in vanilla JS

## Description
An assignment I did for The Odin Project. This one was pretty easy and fun, and really helped cement some important learnings (see below.) 

Uses the openweather api to fetch and display weather for a location entered by the user.

## Learning objectives:
    
  - Develop an understanding of JSON
  - Develop understanding of JS' event loop
  - Develop an understanding of Asynchronous Code in Javascript (promises, async/await, etc.)
  - Gain experience working with APIs

## Acknowledgements

Weather images come from various creators on Pixabay and Pexels. I didn't take the time to note their names, so whoever you are: thank you.
